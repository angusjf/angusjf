I won't persuade anyone to use Vim unless it'll give them all the modern developer luxuries Visual Studio Code has spoiled them with. So I'll explain how to match all those features, without any of the Electron, Microsoft™ or reaching for the mouse.\\n\\n*Note that when I say Vim, I mean [Neovim](https://neovim.io), which I use nowadays - mostly for the LSP integration, which I will talk about further down.*\\n\\n## Plugins, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bloat\\n\\nThe first few times I had attempted to replace VS Code with Vim, I adamantly refused to install any plugins. I zealously shunned any notion of extending Vim with any functionality the application didn't ship with. *\\\"There's no point turning Vim into VS Code, the point is to **use** Vim.\\\"* I'd think, as I struggled to remember the path to that one css file 10-folders deep in the project tree.\\n\\nI've since come to admit defeat and have been proven entirely wrong - but rest assured every plugin I've mentioned here has been seriously considered before installed.\\n\\nTo extend vim with plugins, it's recommended you use a package manager. There are a few to chose from, but I use [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).\\n\\n### Packer\\n\\nTo install `Packer`, clone the repo into your `packpath` as described in the docs then run `:PackerCompile` followed by `:PackerInstall`.\\n\\nOnce installed, packer allows you to write a plugin specification in `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua`, and install the specified plugins with the above commands.\\n\\nHere's what my `plugins.lua` looks like (just to show an example):\\n\\n```lua\\nreturn require('packer').startup(function ()\\n  use 'wbthomason/packer.nvim'\\n  use 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'\\n\\n  use 'tpope/vim-surround'\\n  use 'tpope/vim-fugitive'\\n  use 'tpope/vim-commentary'\\n  use 'tpope/vim-repeat'\\n\\n  use {\\n    'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',\\n    requires = { {'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'} }\\n  }\\n  use {\\n    'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim',\\n    run = 'make'\\n  }\\n\\n  use 'elixir-editors/vim-elixir'\\nend)\\n```\\n\\n## Git Integration\\n\\nThe Git integration you thought you couldn't live without in vscode can be surpassed by the [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) plugin.\\n\\n### Git Sidebar\\n\\nIn vscode, I would often use this sidebar just to swap between the files I had changes in. For this simple case, I use `Telescope`.\\n\\n![Telescope Status](/images/vim/telescope-status.png)\\n\\n```\\n:Telescope :git_status\\n```\\n\\nI find I use this enough rebind it to the space bar. \\n\\nHowever, I also used the VS Code git sidebar to visually stage, unstage and commit files.\\n![Fugitive Status](/images/vim/status.png)\\nThis can be done with the fugitive summary (opened with `:G`), where you can use `s` to stage and `cc` to commit.\\n\\n### Git Diff\\n\\n![Fugitive Diff](/images/vim/diff.png)\\n\\nIn VS Code, clicking a file in the git sidebar opens a diff. In the fugitive summary (`:G`), hit `dd` (or use the command `:Gdiffsplit` from any tracked file) to open diff like the one above.\\n\\n### Git Blame\\n\\n`:G blame` will show you collaborator's names next to the lines they edited.\\n\\n## Language Servers\\n\\nMuch of VS Code's allure comes from it's useful language-aware autocomplete. The Language Server Protocol allows us to recreate the same functionality in Neovim.\\nTo start, install [neovim/nvim-lspconfig](https://www.github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).\\n\\nVS Code comes with some excellent Language Servers by default. Thankfully for us, we can steal them and use them in Vim. To do this, install [vscode-langservers-extracted](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted). This will give you VS Code's helpful tools for HTML, CSS, ESLint and JSON. Once you've added them to your `plugins.lua`, set them up in your init.vim as follows:\\n```\\nlua lspconfig.jsonls.setup{}\\nlua lspconfig.html.setup{}\\nlua lspconfig.cssls.setup{}\\nlua lspconfig.eslint.setup{}\\n```\\n\\n![Errors](/images/vim/errors.png)\\n\\nAs you can see above, errors detected by the Language Server will appear automatically. To see which language servers are active for your current buffer, you can run `:LspInfo`.\\n\\n### Type Detection\\n\\n![Type Hints on Hover](/images/vim/types.png)\\n\\nHovering over an expression to find its type is a very useful feature of VS Code. To recreate this in Vim, we must first install the [TypeScript Language Server](https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server). Now, with your cursor over an expression, running `lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()` will open a window like the one shown above with typing information.\\n\\nIt's, of course, personal preference, but I like to rebind this functionality to the `K` key (which doesn't stray too far from it's traditional meaning in Vim). This can be achieved with the snippet below.\\n```\\nnnoremap K <cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<cr>\\n```\\n\\n### Autocomplete\\n\\n![Autocomplete](/images/vim/autocomplete.png)\\n\\nFor minimal autocomplete functionality without any extra plugins, you can set the following in your `init.vim`.\\n```\\nset omnifunc=v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc\\n```\\nThis allows you to press `CTRL-X CTRL-O` in insert mode to bring up a window like the one above.\\n\\n\\n### Linting (on save)\\n\\nRunning `lua vim.lsp.buf.formatting_sync()` will format the current buffer using a supported language server.\\nTo run this on save, simply add the following command to your `init.vim`.\\n```\\nautocmd BufWritePre * lua vim.lsp.buf.formatting_sync()\\n```\\n\\n### EsLint\\n\\nMany JavaScript projects use `ESLint` - thankfully the extracted language servers we installed before gives us support for this.\\nI use the following snippet to skip the typescript language server I have installed and instead use the ESLint one on save.\\n```\\nautocmd BufWritePre *.hs,*.elm,*.ex,*.html,*.json,*.css lua vim.lsp.buf.formatting_sync()\\nautocmd BufWritePre *.tsx,*.ts,*.jsx,*.js EslintFixAll\\n```\\n\\n### Code Actions\\n\\n![Code Actions](/images/vim/code-actions.png)\\nCode actions, such as organising imports, can be viewed and executed with `:Telescope lsp_code_actions`.\\nTo place the Telescope window next to the cursor, I use the following command in my `init.vim`:\\n```\\nnnoremap <leader>a <cmd>Telescope lsp_code_actions initial_mode=normal theme=cursor<cr>\\n```\\n\\n### Go To Denfinition \\n\\nIn vscode, you can ⌘-click to 'click through' to the definition of a symbol. The same can be done in vim with `lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()`, which I rebind to `gD`.\\n\\n### \\\"Commenting Out\\\" Lines\\nIn vscode, ⌘/ will toggle the current line between commented and uncommented.\\nThe same functionality can be added to Vim by installing 'tpope/vim-commentary'.\\nThis allows you to use `gcc` to toggle a line to a comment in a language-syntax-aware way.\\n\\n## File Search\\n\\n![Searching by content](/images/vim/grep.png)\\n\\n### By Name\\n\\nThe VS Code \\\"file picker\\\" is seriously handy - In Vim we can get the same functionality from [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim).\\nThe classic vscode file picker can be recreated with `:Telescope find_files`, which respects your `.gitignore`.\\n\\nIt's suggested that you also install [telescope-fzf-native](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim) to improve performance.\\nOnce you have installed it, remember to add the line below to your `init.vim` to load it on startup.\\n```\\nrequire('telescope').load_extension('fzf')\\n```\\n\\n### By Content\\n\\nVSCode also allows you to search for strings globally in your project. This can be done from the command line using `ripgrep` (`rg`), and can be performed in Vim using a Telescope window.\\n`:Telescope live-grep` will bring up a search window like the one shown above.\\n\\n### File Tree\\n\\nVim actually has a file tree mode built in to it's default file browser, `netrw`.\\nAdd the following line to your `init.vim` to enable it.\\n```\\nlet g:netrw_liststyle=3\\n```\\nYou can then use `:Vex` from Vim or `vim .` from bash to open netrw and see the tree view.\\n\\n![Vim tree view](/images/vim/tree.png)\\n\\n## Tabs\\n\\nVim has tabs built right in - use `:tabnew` to open a blank one of `:tabe[dit] {filename}` to open a file.\\nIn a `Telescope` window, use `CTRL-T` to open the currently selected file in a new tab.\\n\\nYou can use `gt` to swap between tabs (and `gT` for the reverse direction), or `g<TAB>` to swap between the last two.\\nI recommend rebinding this to just the tab key.\\n\\n## Colour Schemes\\n\\n![Changing color scheme with Telescope](/images/vim/color-schemes.gif)\\nVS Code has this really cute feature where you can use `⌘K ⌘T` to quickly swap between color schemes.\\nYou can replicate this in Vim with the following command:\\n```\\n:Telescope colorscheme enable_preview=true initial_mode=normal theme=dropdown\\n```\\n\\n*I hope you found this helpful!
